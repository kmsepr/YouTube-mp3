## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/youtube-radio.git
cd youtube-radio

2. Install Python dependencies:



pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Ensure yt-dlp and ffmpeg are installed and in your PATH.


4. Place your YouTube cookies file at /mnt/data/cookies.txt (optional but recommended).


5. Edit the PLAYLISTS dictionary in app.py to include your desired playlists.

Usage

Run the Flask app:

python app.py

Access the homepage: http://localhost:5000/

Listen to a playlist: http://localhost:5000/listen/<playlist_name>

Download MP3: http://localhost:5000/stream/<playlist_name>


The app will automatically start streaming all playlists in the background.


---

Configuration

PLAYLISTS: Add multiple playlists with unique names.

MAX_QUEUE_SIZE: Maximum chunks to hold in memory for streaming (default 100).

CACHE_FILE: Path to cache video IDs to avoid repeated scraping.

COOKIES_PATH: Path to YouTube cookies file.



---

Notes

The server uses Flask's development server; for production, deploy with a WSGI server like gunicorn.

Some videos may still fail due to region-locking, age restrictions, or YouTube restrictions.

Direct audio URLs are fetched with yt-dlp -g for stability.

Logs are written to /mnt/data/radio.log.

Example PLAYLISTS configuration

PLAYLISTS = {
    "Malayalam": "https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLYKzjRvMAychqR_ysgXiHAywPUsVw0AzE",
